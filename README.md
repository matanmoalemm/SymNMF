Implemented the K-Means and Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) algorithms using Python and C API to enhance efficiency. K-Means clusters data points based on similarity, while SymNMF decomposes similarity matrices to identify hidden patterns. Leveraging Pythonâ€™s versatility with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, alongside the computational power of C, these implementations achieved precise clustering with improved runtime performance.
